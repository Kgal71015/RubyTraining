# Your task is to write a Ruby Parser that receives a file (see attached `webserver.log`) and parses it to some output like:
# List of webpages with most page views

# /about/2 90
# /contact 89
# /index 82
# /about 81
# /help_page/1 80
# /home 78

# List of webpages with most unique visits

# /help_page/1 23
# /contact 23
# /home 23
# /index 23
# /about/2 22
# /about 21

# Preferable if you do it OOP-styled.
# Try to keep DRY.
# Try to keep to SOLID principles if possible but major point is to learn how to make piece of code. SOLID in ruby will come with time and practice.
# If capable â€“ try to implement some checks, validations, error handling, etc.
